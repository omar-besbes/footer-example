This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) & [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com).

## What I did

First, I extracted all the fonts, colors & other stylings from figma and configured tailwind accordingly. Check
out `tailwind.config.js`.
Then, I began working on the footer component beginning with the structure of it.
As always, the tricky part is the responsiveness of the component. I try different possible layouts until I find one
that is good enough and is good-looking on all screens.

> **_Note on allocation of space to each section:_**
> At first, I allocated the same (equal) space for all 3 sections.
> But then, I noticed that the 3rd section didn't need as much space as the second.
> So I divided the inside of the footer to 10 equal parts and allocated 3, 4 and 3 parts for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
> sections
> respectively.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
